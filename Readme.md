Features

*Features marked with an asterisk are minimum viable product features. Others are nice-to-have.*

**Finding a repo:**
- Search for a repo by name*
- Filter by language or other advanced filters 
- pull starred repos

**Checking for new releases:**
- By default, poll every {interval} (2 hours?)*
- Allow per-repo polling schedule

**List my 'watched repos'**
- See the repos I’m watching.*
- Remove repos from the list*
- Star a watched repo on GitHub

**Show Release Notes:**
- When a new release is found, mark as new and send a local notification*
- Clicking on a notification either:
    - opens a list of the new releases
or
    - if there’s only one new release, shows the release notes

- Another approach may to be fire off notifications for each repo and tie a notification to release notes, but that could get clunky if a user follows too many notifications.*

**Bonus:** Notification Center widget?
